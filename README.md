# Real Estate Broker Information Extractor

## Description
This project involves developing a web scraping tool to extract real estate brokers' information from the Homes website. The tool allows users to input a location and then scrapes data to retrieve all real estate brokers in that specified area.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** For writing the main script and handling data processing.
- **BeautifulSoup:** For parsing HTML content and extracting the relevant information.
- **Selenium:** For automating browser interactions when necessary.
- **CSV:** For storing the extracted data in a structured format.

## Key Features
- **User Input:** The user can specify the location they want to search for real estate brokers.
- **Automated Data Extraction:** The script navigates the Homes website, searches for the specified location, and extracts detailed information about each real estate broker, including name, contact information, and agency details.
- **Data Storage:** The extracted information is saved into a CSV file for easy access and analysis.

## Challenges Overcome
- Handling dynamic web content that requires interaction with JavaScript elements.
- Ensuring that the extracted data is accurate and complete, given the variability in the website's structure.
- Implementing error handling to manage potential issues such as missing data or changes in the website layout.

## Outcome
The project successfully provided a reliable and efficient tool for gathering real estate broker information, which can be used for market analysis, lead generation, or other business purposes.
